# etch-a-sketch

This is a sample Etch-A-Sketch that I created for The Odin Project.

The current status of the project is: Complete.

You can find a live version of this project <a href="https://cstobler.github.io/etch-a-sketch/">here</a>

I used a CSS Grid for the actual visual representation of the rudimentary Etch-A-Sketch. If you are working your way through The Odin Project, and you are having trouble implementing the CSS Grid, look up the repeat() function. You're welcome :)
